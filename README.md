## Repository of useful R scripts 

Place for housing code that I've manipulated or created for data analysis. 

### Contents: 

* Aesthetics contains scripts for producing color palletes and consistent plot axes. 
* Corr has correlation matrix creation scripts(but this has been incorporated into a package [here](https://github.com/brownegm/corrfx).
* hydraulics has functions and protocols for curve fitting hydraulic vulnerability data, which will also 
    be added to [a package](https://github.com/brownegm/hydrafit) with bootstrapping capabilities.
