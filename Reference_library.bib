  abstract = {Drought-related tree die-off episodes have been observed in all vegetated continents. Despite much research effort, however, the multiple interactions between carbon starvation, hydraulic failure and biotic agents in driving tree mortality under field conditions are still not well understood. We analysed the seasonal variability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in four organs (leaves, branches, trunk and roots), the vulnerability to embolism in roots and branches, native embolism (percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC)) in branches and the presence of root rot pathogens in defoliated and non-defoliated individuals in a declining Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) population in the NE Iberian Peninsula in 2012, which included a particularly dry and warm summer. No differences were observed between defoliated and non-defoliated pines in hydraulic parameters, except for a higher vulnerability to embolism at pressures below -2 MPa in roots of defoliated pines. No differences were found between defoliation classes in branch PLC. Total NSC (TNSC, soluble sugars plus starch) values decreased during drought, particularly in leaves. Defoliation reduced TNSC levels across tree organs, especially just before (June) and during (August) drought. Root rot infection by the fungal pathogen Onnia P. Karst spp. was detected but it did not appear to be associated to tree defoliation. However, Onnia infection was associated with reduced leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and sapwood depth, and thus contributed to hydraulic impairment, especially in defoliated pines. Infection was also associated with virtually depleted root starch reserves during and after drought in defoliated pines. Moreover, defoliated and infected trees tended to show lower basal area increment. Overall, our results show the intertwined nature of physiological mechanisms leading to drought-induced mortality and the inherent difficulty of isolating their contribution under field conditions.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since industrialization is characterized by large interannual variability, mostly resulting from variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (typically termed carbon sink). However, the contributions of regional ecosystems to that variability are not well known. Using an ensemble of ecosystem and land-surface models and an empirical observation-based product of global gross primary production, we show that the mean sink, trend, and interannual variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by distinct biogeographic regions. Whereas the mean sink is dominated by highly productive lands (mainly tropical forests), the trend and interannual variability of the sink are dominated by semi-arid ecosystems whose carbon balance is strongly associated with circulation-driven variations in both precipitation and temperature. The difference is found at the margins The terrestrial biosphere absorbs about a quarter of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but the amount that they take up varies from year to year. Why? Combining models and observations, Ahlstr\"om et al. found that marginal ecosystems\textemdash semiarid savannas and low-latitude shrublands\textemdash are responsible for most of the variability. Biological productivity in these semiarid regions is water-limited and strongly associated with variations in precipitation, unlike wetter tropical areas. Understanding carbon uptake by these marginal lands may help to improve predictions of variations in the global carbon cycle. Science, this issue p. 895},

  abstract = {Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

Several indicators can now be used to estimate this response, the most widely available of which is leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}LWP) as measured with a pressure chamber. For many annual crops, the predawn leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}PLWP), assumed to represent the mean soil water potential next to the roots, is closely correlated to the relative transpiration rate, RT. A similar correlation also holds for young fruit trees grown in containers. However, exceptions to this rule are common when soil water content is markedly heterogeneous.}

We perform a meta-analysis across 33 studies that span all forested biomes and find that, among the examined traits, hydraulic traits explain cross-species patterns in mortality from drought. Gymnosperm and angiosperm mortality was associated with different hydraulic traits, giving insight into the relative weights of different traits and mechanisms in mortality prediction. Our results provide a foundation for more mechanistic predictions of drought-induced tree mortality across Earth's diverse forests.Drought-induced tree mortality has been observed globally and is expected to increase under climate change scenarios, with large potential consequences for the terrestrial carbon sink. Predicting mortality across species is crucial for assessing the effects of climate extremes on forest community biodiversity, composition, and carbon sequestration. However, the physiological traits associated with elevated risk of mortality in diverse ecosystems remain unknown, although these traits could greatly improve understanding and prediction of tree mortality in forests. We performed a meta-analysis on species' mortality rates across 475 species from 33 studies around the globe to assess which traits determine a species' mortality risk. We found that species-specific mortality anomalies from community mortality rate in a given drought were associated with plant hydraulic traits. Across all species, mortality was best predicted by a low hydraulic safety margin\textemdash the difference between typical minimum xylem water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction\textemdash and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Angiosperms and gymnosperms experienced roughly equal mortality risks. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis that hydraulic traits capture key mechanisms determining tree death and highlight that physiological traits can improve vegetation model prediction of tree mortality during climate extremes.}

The knowledge of the plant water content could be indispensable for water saving strategies. Terahertz spectroscopic techniques are particularly promising as a non-invasive tool for measuring leaf water content, thanks to the high predominance of the water contribution to the total leaf absorption. Terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCL) are one of the most successful sources of THz radiation. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Here we present a new method which improves the precision of THz techniques by combining a transmission measurement performed using a THz QCL source, with simple pictures of leaves taken by an optical camera. As a proof of principle, we performed transmission measurements on six plants of Vitis vinifera L. (cv ``Colorino''). We found a linear law which relates the leaf water mass to the product between the leaf optical depth in the THz and the projected area. Results are in optimal agreement with the proposed law, which reproduces the experimental data with 95\% accuracy. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This method may overcome the issues related to intra-variety heterogeneities and retrieve the leaf water mass in a fast, simple, and non-invasive way. In the future this technique could highlight different behaviours in preserving the water status during drought stress.},

  abstract = {Many species face increasing drought under climate change. Plasticity has been predicted to strongly influence species' drought responses, but broad patterns in plasticity have not been examined for key drought tolerance traits, including turgor loss or `wilting' point (ptlp). As soil dries, plants shift ptlp by accumulating solutes (i.e. `osmotic adjustment'). We conducted the first global analysis of plasticity in Dptlp and related traits for 283 wild and crop species in ecosystems worldwide. Dptlp was widely prevalent but moderate (\`A0.44 MPa), accounting for 16\% of post-drought ptlp. Thus, pre-drought ptlp was a considerably stronger predictor of post-drought ptlp across species of wild plants. For cultivars of certain crops Dptlp accounted for major differences in postdrought ptlp. Climate was correlated with pre- and post-drought ptlp, but not Dptlp. Thus, despite the wide prevalence of plasticity, ptlp measured in one season can reliably characterise most species' constitutive drought tolerances and distributions relative to water supply.},

  abstract = {Sap flow sensors were installed on the leaf petioles of 5-year-old oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) to measure the xylem water flow for 12 days based on the heat ratio method (HRM). It was found that young leaves have higher sap flow rates, reaching values of over 250 cm3 h-1, and that sap flow fluctuations are directly related to weather conditions, particularly the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) component. It was observed that the sap flow rates remained constant and very close to 0 cm3 h-1 between 18:00 and 6:00 h and that the upward and downward movement of sap was faster during the day, with peak levels between 9:00 and 16:00 h. Under the evaluation conditions, the oil palm crop transpiration was estimated to be 1.15 mm H2O/ha-day. The HRM is a highly repeatable method and an useful tool to quantify the total oil palm transpiration. It could potentially be applied to irrigation.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The expression of an individual genotype is modified by its environment. The amount by which it can be modified is termed its plasticity. This plasticity can be either morphological or physiological; these are interrelated. The plasticity of a character is related to the general pattern of its development, and apart from this, that plasticity is a general property of the whole genotype. Plasticity of a character appears to be specific for that character, specific in relation to particular environmental influences, specific in direction, under genetic control not necessarily related to heterozygosity, and able to be radically altered by selection. Because plants are static organisms, plasticity is of marked adaptive value in a great number of situations. Examples of all these situations in plant species are discussed. They indicate that adaptation by plasticity is a widespread and important phenomenon in plants and has evolved differently in different species. The mechanisms involved in plasticity are varied. At one extreme, the character shows a continuous range of modification dependent on the intensity of the environmental stimulus. At the other, the character shows only two discrete modifications. The stimulus causing these modifications may be direct or indirect. The mechanisms found can be related to the particular environmental situation involved.}

  abstract = {The intricate patterns of veins that adorn the leaves of land plants are among the most important networks in biology. Water flows in these leaf irrigation networks under tension and is vulnerable to embolism-forming cavitations, which cut off water supply, ultimately causing leaf death. Understanding the ways in which plants structure their vein supply network to protect against embolism-induced failure has enormous ecological and evolutionary implications, but until now there has been no way of observing dynamic failure in natural leaf networks. Here we use a new optical method that allows the initiation and spread of embolism bubbles in the leaf network to be visualized. Examining embolism-induced failure of architecturally diverse leaf networks, we found that conservative rules described the progression of hydraulic failure within veins. The most fundamental rule was that within an individual venation network, susceptibility to embolism always increased proportionally with the size of veins, and initial nucleation always occurred in the largest vein. Beyond this general framework, considerable diversity in the pattern of network failure was found between species, related to differences in vein network topology. The highest-risk network was found in a fern species, where single events caused massive disruption to leaf water supply, whereas safer networks in angiosperm leaves contained veins with composite properties, allowing a staged failure of water supply. These results reveal how the size structure of leaf venation is a critical determinant of the spread of embolism damage to leaves during drought.},

  abstract = {Abstract Leaf venation is diverse across plant species and has practical applications from paleobotany to modern agriculture. However, the impact of vein traits on plant performance has not yet been tested in a model system such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies analysed cotyledons of A.?thaliana vein mutants and identified visible differences in their vein systems from the wild type (WT). We measured leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf), vein traits, and xylem and mesophyll anatomy for A.?thaliana?WT (Col-0) and four vein mutants (dot3-111 and dot3-134, and cvp1-3 and cvp2-1). Mutant true leaves did not possess the qualitative venation anomalies previously shown in the cotyledons, but varied quantitatively in vein traits and leaf anatomy across genotypes. The WT had significantly higher mean Kleaf. Across all genotypes, there was a strong correlation of Kleaf with traits related to hydraulic conductance across the bundle sheath, as influenced by the number and radial diameter of bundle sheath cells and vein length per area. These findings support the hypothesis that vein traits influence Kleaf, indicating the usefulness of this mutant system for testing theory that was primarily established comparatively across species, and supports a strong role for the bundle sheath in influencing Kleaf.},

  abstract = {Metrics that synthesize the complex effects of climate change are essential tools for mapping future threats to biodiversity and predicting which species are likely to adapt in place to new climatic conditions, disperse and establish in areas with newly suitable climate, or face the prospect of extirpation. The most commonly used of such metrics is the velocity of climate change, which estimates the speed at which species must migrate over the earth's surface to maintain constant climatic conditions. However, ``analog-based'' velocities, which represent the actual distance to where analogous climates will be found in the future, may provide contrasting results to the more common form of velocity based on local climate gradients. Additionally, whereas climatic velocity reflects the exposure of organisms to climate change, resultant biotic effects are dependent on the sensitivity of individual species as reflected in part by their climatic niche width. This has motivated development of biotic velocity, a metric which uses data on projected species range shifts to estimate the velocity at which species must move to track their climatic niche. We calculated climatic and biotic velocity for the Western Hemisphere for 1961\textendash 2100, and applied the results to example ecological and conservation planning questions, to demonstrate the potential of such analog-based metrics to provide information on broad-scale patterns of exposure and sensitivity. Geographic patterns of biotic velocity for 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians differed from climatic velocity in north temperate and boreal regions. However, both biotic and climatic velocities were greatest at low latitudes, implying that threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of climatic velocities and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability. Biotic and climatic velocity, by approximating lower and upper bounds on migration rates, can inform conservation of species and locally-adapted populations, respectively, and in combination with backward velocity, a function of distance to a source of colonizers adapted to a site's future climate, can facilitate conservation of diversity at multiple scales in the face of climate change.},

Most individuals occurred in sites between 20 and 60\% of the height of the tree, and directly on the main trunk or branches closed to the main trunk. During the dry season, individuals received about nine times more photon flux density (PFD) than during the rainy season. Individuals that occurred under 30\textendash 59\% of the daily ambient PFD showed greater leaf length increase and monthly leaf production, and produced more flowers than individuals in the brighter ({$>$}60\% of ambient PFD) and the darker (11\textendash 29\% of ambient PFD) light microhabitats. Well-watered plants acclimated to deep shade (6\% of ambient PFD) showed values of tissue acidity similar to plants under higher light treatments. Well-watered plants under 60\% of daily ambient PFD showed low values of maximum quantum efficiency at midday during most of the year but showed similar values of tissue acidity than plants under 6 and 30\% of ambient PFD. Leaf temperatures of plants in low sites within the canopy and on the forest floor were significantly higher than the air during about 1 h, indicating that those plants could not dissipate the excess of heat. Individuals located in the most shaded microhabitats could also receive less amount of water from rainfall and dew. Therefore, it would be less damaging for this epiphytic bromeliad to occur in the most exposed microhabitats than in the most shaded microhabitats in this tropical dry forest.},

To evaluate competing mechanisms influencing urban vegetation cover and tree biodiversity, we collected data from 350 plots in the City of Los Angeles, CA. Alpha (\k{}) and beta (\textasciicaron ) tree biodiversity were quantified using sample based rarefaction curves. Hypotheses of independent climate, land use, luxury and legacy effects were evaluated with residual regression analysis and best models were chosen using AIC. Residential land use had the highest \k{} biodiversity at all sampling scales, but the lowest \textasciicaron{} diversity, possibly indicating a limited plant pool for managers. Increased median household income was independently related to each type of vegetation cover, supporting a luxury effect. Regression models explaining the most variation in cover also included population density. In contrast, tree species richness was only positively related to housing age, supporting the legacy effect. Median income had no independent effect on tree biodiversity, which contrasts with patterns in other arid cities. However, age and income had an interactive effect. The highest \k{} and \textasciicaron{} tree diversity were found in old, high-income locations. Managing for ecosystem services provided by vegetation should prioritize low income neighborhoods for increasing cover, while managing for biodiversity should maintain existing diversity in older neighborhoods and encourage new species in newer neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {The release of carbon from tropical forests may exacerbate future climate change, but the magnitude of the effect in climate models remains uncertain. Coupled climate\textendash carbon-cycle models generally agree that carbon storage on land will increase as a result of the simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but will decrease owing to higher soil and plant respiration rates associated with warming temperatures. At present, the balance between these effects varies markedly among coupled climate\textendash carbon-cycle models, leading to a range of 330 gigatonnes in the projected change in the amount of carbon stored on tropical land by 2100. Explanations for this large uncertainty include differences in the predicted change in rainfall in Amazonia and variations in the responses of alternative vegetation models to warming. Here we identify an emergent linear relationship, across an ensemble of models, between the sensitivity of tropical land carbon storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth rate of atmospheric CO2 to tropical temperature anomalies. Combined with contemporary observations of atmospheric CO2 concentration and tropical temperature, this relationship provides a tight constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change. We estimate that over tropical land from latitude 30\textdegree{} north to 30\textdegree{} south, warming alone will release 53 {$\pm$} 17 gigatonnes of carbon per kelvin. Compared with the unconstrained ensemble of climate\textendash carbon-cycle projections, this indicates a much lower risk of Amazon forest dieback under CO2-induced climate change if CO2 fertilization effects are as large as suggested by current models. Our study, however, also implies greater certainty that carbon will be lost from tropical land if warming arises from reductions in aerosols or increases in other greenhouse gases.},

  abstract = {Premise of the Study Studies across diverse species have established theory for the contribution of leaf traits to plant drought tolerance. For example, species in more arid climates tend to have smaller leaves of higher vein density, higher leaf mass per area, and more negative osmotic potential at turgor loss point ({$\pi$}TLP). However, few studies have tested these associations for species within a given lineage that have diversified across an aridity gradient. Methods We analyzed the anatomy and physiology of 10 Ceanothus (Rhamnaceae) species grown in a common garden for variation between and within ``wet'' and ``dry'' subgenera (Ceanothus and Cerastes, respectively) and analyzed a database for 35 species for leaf size and leaf mass per area (LMA). We used a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach to test hypothesized relationships among traits, and of traits with climatic aridity in the native range. We also tested for allometric relationships among anatomical traits. Key Results Leaf form, anatomy, and drought tolerance varied strongly among species within and between subgenera. Cerastes species had specialized anatomy including hypodermis and encrypted stomata that may confer superior water storage and retention. The osmotic potentials at turgor loss point ({$\pi$}TLP) and full turgor ({$\pi$}o) showed evolutionary correlations with the aridity index (AI) and precipitation of the 10 species' native distributions, and LMA with potential evapotranspiration for the 35 species in the larger database. We found an allometric correlation between upper and lower epidermal cell wall thicknesses, but other anatomical traits diversified independently. Conclusions Leaf traits and drought tolerance evolved within and across lineages of Ceanothus consistently with climatic distributions. The {$\pi$}TLP has signal to indicate the evolution of drought tolerance within small clades.},

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.},

The first is an improvement in the environment, and the second is an improvement in economic efficiency from the use of environmental tax revenues to reduce other taxes such as income taxes that distort labor supply and saving decisions. In this paper, we make four main points. First, the validity of the double-dividend hypothesis cannot logically be settled as a general matter. Second, the focus on revenue in this literature is misplaced. We demonstrate that three policies have equivalent impacts on the environment and on labor supply. One of those policies raises revenue from the environmental component of the reform, another loses revenue, and a third has no revenue associated with it. Third, what matters is the creation of privately-held scarcity rents. Policies that raise product prices through some restriction on behavior may create scarcity rents. Unless those rents are captured by the government, such policies are less efficient at ameliorating an environmental problem than are policies that do not create rents. Finally, we distinguish between two types of command and control regulations on the basis of whether they create scarcity rents.},

  abstract = {Feedbacks between land carbon pools and climate provide one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our predictions of global climate. Estimates of the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon budget to climate anomalies in the tropics and the identification of the mechanisms responsible for feedback effects remain uncertain. The Amazon basin stores a vast amount of carbon, and has experienced increasingly higher temperatures and more frequent floods and droughts over the past two decades. Here we report seasonal and annual carbon balances across the Amazon basin, based on carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide measurements for the anomalously dry and wet years 2010 and 2011, respectively. We find that the Amazon basin lost 0.48 {$\pm$} 0.18 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr-1) during the dry year but was carbon neutral (0.06 {$\pm$} 0.1 Pg C yr-1) during the wet year. Taking into account carbon losses from fire by using carbon monoxide measurements, we derived the basin net biome exchange (that is, the carbon flux between the non-burned forest and the atmosphere) revealing that during the dry year, vegetation was carbon neutral. During the wet year, vegetation was a net carbon sink of 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.14 Pg C yr-1, which is roughly consistent with the mean long-term intact-forest biomass sink of 0.39 {$\pm$} 0.10 Pg C yr-1 previously estimated from forest censuses. Observations from Amazonian forest plots suggest the suppression of photosynthesis during drought as the primary cause for the 2010 sink neutralization. Overall, our results suggest that moisture has an important role in determining the Amazonian carbon balance. If the recent trend of increasing precipitation extremes persists, the Amazon may become an increasing carbon source as a result of both emissions from fires and the suppression of net biome exchange by drought.},

  abstract = {Terahertz technology is still an evolving research field that attracts scientists with very different backgrounds working on a wide range of subjects. In the past two decades, it has been demonstrated that terahertz technology can provide a non-invasive tool for measuring and monitoring the water content of leaves and plants. In this paper we intend to review the different possibilities to perform in-vivo water status measurements on plants with the help of THz and subTHz waves. The common basis of the different methods is the strong absorption of THz and sub-THz waves by liquid water. In contrast to simpler, yet destructive, methods THz and sub-THz waves allow for the continuous monitoring of plant water status over several days on the same sample. The technologies, which we take into focus, are THz time domain spectroscopy, THz continuous wave setups, THz quasi time domain spectroscopy and sub-THz continuous wave setups. These methods differ with respect to the generation and detection schemes, the covered frequency range, the processing and evaluation of the experimental data, and the mechanical handling of the measurements. Consequently, we explain which method fits best in which situation. Finally, we discuss recent and future technological developments towards more compact and budget-priced measurement systems for use in the field.},

  abstract = {As forests, agricultural fields, and suburban and urban lands are replaced with impervious surfaces resulting from development, the necessity to recover green space is becoming increasingly critical to maintain environmental quality. Vegetated or green roofs are one potential remedy for this problem. Establishing plant material on rooftops provides numerous ecological and economic benefits, including stormwater management, energy conservation, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, and increased longevity of roofing membranes, as well as providing a more aesthetically pleasing environment in which to work and live. Furthermore, the construction and maintenance of green roofs provide business opportunities for nurseries, landscape contractors, irrigation specialists, and other green industry members while addressing the issues of environmental stewardship. This paper is a review of current knowledge regarding the benefits of green roofs, plant selection and culture, and barriers to their acceptance in the United States. Because of building weight restrictions and costs, shallow-substrate extensive roofs are much more common than deeper intensive roofs. Therefore, the focus of this review is primarily on extensive green roofs.},

  abstract = {Forest degradation is a global environmental issue, but its definition is problematic. Difficulties include choosing appropriate reference states, timescales, thresholds, and forest values. We dispense with many such ambiguities by interpreting forest degradation through the frame of ecological resilience, and with reference to forest dynamics. Specifically, we define forest degradation as a state of anthropogenically induced arrested succession, where ecological processes that underlie forest dynamics are diminished or severely constrained. Metrics of degradation might include those that reflect ecological processes shaping community dynamics, notably the regeneration of plant species. Arrested succession implies that management intervention is necessary to recover successional trajectories. Such a definition can be applied to any forest ecosystem, and can also be extended to other ecosystems., Forest degradation results in biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and diminution of ecosystem goods and services, but scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers are unable to agree a framework for defining degradation., Forests are spatially and temporally dynamic, and this stymies the selection of appropriate reference states, timescales, and thresholds against which degradation might be determined., Degradation is often defined as reduced capacity to provide goods and services. This definition takes little account of forest resilience \textendash{} the ability of a system to reorganize and recover following disturbance., Advances in describing and quantifying ecosystem functioning have been fundamental in understanding forest dynamics, and provide a promising framework by which degradation might be better understood and, ultimately, defined.},

  abstract = {{$<$}P{$>$}Whole-plant energy capture depends not only on the photosynthetic response of individual leaves, but also on their integration into an effective canopy, and on the costs of producing and maintaining their photosynthetic capacity. This paper explores adaptation to irradiance level in this context, focusing on traits whose significance would be elusive if considered in terms of their impact at the leaf level alone. I review traditional approaches used to demonstrate or suggest adaptation to irradiance level, and outline three energetic tradeoffs likely to shape such adaptation, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and biotic interactions. Recent models using these tradeoffs to account for trends in leaf nitrogen content, stornatal conductance, phyllotaxis, and defensive allocations in sun v. shade are evaluated. {$<$}/P{$><$}P{$>$} A re-evaluation of the classic study of acclimation of the photosynthetic light response in \emph{Atriplex}, crucial to interpreting adaptation to irradiance in many traits, shows that it does not completely support the central dogma of adaptation to sun v. shade unless the results are analysed in terms of whole-plant energy capture. Calculations for \emph{Liriodendron} show that the traditional light compensation point has little meaning for net carbon gain, and that the effective compensation point is profoundly influenced by the costs of night leaf respiration, leaf construction, and the construction of associated support and root tissue. The costs of support tissue are especially important, raising the effective compensation point by 140 \textmu mol m\textsuperscript{-2} s\textsuperscript{-1} in trees 1 m tall, and by nearly 1350 \textmu mol m\textsuperscript{-2} s\textsuperscript{-1} in trees 30 m tall. Effective compensation points give maximum tree heights as a function of irradiance, and shade tolerance as a function of tree height; calculations of maximum permissible height in \emph{Liriodendron} correspond roughly with the height of the tallest known individual. Finally, new models for the evolution of canopy width/height ratio in response to irradiance and coverage within a tree stratum, and for the evolution of mottled leaves as a defensive measure in understory herbs, are outlined.{$<$}/P{$>$}},

We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (Dcrown=1.05My-1), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (Dcrown=0.67My-1), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86\% of total species richness in the family. This study is among the first to test a priori hypotheses about the relationships among phylogeny, phenotypic evolution, geographic spread, and net species diversification, and to argue for causality to flow from functional diversity to spatial expansion to species diversity.},

We examined three traits contributing to longer desiccation times in excised shoots of 11 species from two sites of contrasting aridity: (i) the amount of water released from plant tissues per decrease in xylem water potential (W{$\Psi$}); (ii) the minimum xylem water potential preceding acute water stress (defined as P50L; water potential at 50\% loss of leaf conductance); and (iii) the integrated transpiration rate between the points of full hydration and P50L (Wtime). The time required for species to reach P50L varied markedly, ranging from 1.3 h to nearly 3 days. W{$\Psi$}, P50L and Wtime all contributed significantly to longer desiccation times, explaining 28, 22 and 50\% of the variance in the time required to reach P50L. Interestingly, these three traits were nearly orthogonal to one another, suggesting that they do not represent alternative hydraulic strategies, but likely trade off with other ecological strategies not evaluated in this study. The majority of water lost during desiccation (60\textendash 91\%) originated from leaves, suggesting an important role for leaf capacitance in small plants when xylem water potentials decrease below -2 MPa.},

  abstract = {Plants have evolved photoprotective mechanisms to limit photodamage; one of these mechanisms involves the biosynthesis of antioxidant metabolites to neutralize reactive oxygen species generated when plants are exposed to excess light. However, it is known that exposure of plants to conditions of extreme water stress and high light intensity results in their enhanced susceptibility to over-excitation of photosystem II and to photooxidative stress. In this investigation we used the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl reduction assay to conduct a broad survey of the effect of water availability and light exposure conditions on the antioxidant activity of the leaf extracts of two bromeliad species showing crassulacean acid metabolism. One of these was an epiphyte, Tillandsia brachycaulos, and the other a terrestrial species, Bromelia karatas. Both species were found growing wild in the tropical dry deciduous forest of Dzibilchalt\'un National Park, M\'exico. The microenvironment of T. brachycaulos and B. karatas experiences significant diurnal and seasonal light variations as well as changes in temperature and water availability. The results obtained showed that, for both bromeliads, increases in antioxidant activity occurred during the dry season, as a consequence of water stress and higher light conditions. Additionally, in T. brachycaulos there was a clear correlation between high light intensity conditions and the content of anthocyanins which accumulated below the leaf epidermis. This result suggests that the role of these pigments is as photoprotective screens in the leaves. The red coloration below the leaf epidermis of B. karatas was not due to anthocyanins but to other unidentified pigments.},

Photoprotective strategies were investigated in 10 epiphytic bromeliad species in Trinidad with contrasting preferences for the light environment, according to exposure groups categorized by C.S. Pittendrigh in 1948 (viz. Exposure, Sun and Shade-Tolerant). 2. Chlorophyll a/b ratios were relatively consistent under both high and low light, despite large differences in total chlorophyll content. 3. Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis were examined in three C3 species. Carboxylation limitation was ubiquitous and despite some evidence for the operation of alternative electron sinks, utilization of photon energy was minimal. 4. Irrespective of exposure group and photosynthetic pathway (C3 or CAM), all species exhibited a very high capacity for thermal dissipation of excess excitation. 5. Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in leaves of Exposure and Sun Group species was largely rapidly relaxing, indicative of a photoprotective down-regulation of photosynthesis. In contrast more slowly relaxing quenching (qI) was the major component in the Shade-Tolerant Group, suggesting a greater probability of photodamage for species within this group. 6. C.S. Pittendrigh supported the view that many bromeliads low in the canopy were shade-tolerant, suggesting that the epiphytic ancestor originated in exposed, open regions. Our fluorescence quenching data support this assertion.},

  abstract = {Many plant processes are affected by mild water stress, with cell growth probably the most sensitive. Except for turgor-mediated processes, the physicochemical basis for the transduction of small changes in water status into alterations in metabolism remains obscure. Turgor pressure is assigned a critical role in cell growth: the physical force needed to sustain enlargement. Simple physical models relating growth to turgor are conceptually useful in examining effects of water stress but can be misleading because metabolic and regulatory responses may be marked and vary temporally. Osmotic adjustment has long been known as a means by which higher plants adapt to salinity, with much of the cell osmotica being ionic and accumulated from the medium. Though not generally recognized, osmotic adjustment also appears to be an important mechanism for adaptation to water-limiting conditions, even in mesophytic plants. In this case much of the osmotica might possibly be internally generated. Recent field data on seasonal and diurnal adjustment and vertical water-potential gradients in plant canopies are discussed relative to growth and water-potential components.}

  abstract = {Water transport is an integral part of the process of growth by cell expansion and accounts for most of the increase in cell volume characterizing growth. Under water deficiency, growth is readily inhibited and growth of roots is favoured over that of leaves. The mechanisms underlying this differential response are examined in terms of Lockhart's equations and water transport. For roots, when water potential ({$\Psi$}) is suddenly reduced, osmotic adjustment occurs rapidly to allow partial turgor recovery and re-establishment of {$\Psi$} gradient for water uptake, and the loosening ability of the cell wall increases as indicated by a rapid decline in yield-threshold turgor. These adjustments permit roots to resume growth under low {$\Psi$}. In contrast, in leaves under reductions in {$\Psi$} of similar magnitude, osmotic adjustment occurs slowly and wall loosening ability either does not increase substantially or actually decreases, leading to marked growth inhibition. The growth region of both roots and leaves are hydraulically isolated from the vascular system. This isolation protects the root from low {$\Psi$} in the mature xylem and facilitates the continued growth into new moist soil volume. Simulations with a leaky cable model that includes a sink term for growth water uptake show that growth zone {$\Psi$} is barely affected by soil water removal through transpiration. On the other hand, hydraulic isolation dictates that {$\Psi$} of the leaf growth region would be low and subjected to further reduction by high evaporative demand. Thus, a combination of transport and changes in growth parameters is proposed as the mechanism co-ordinating the growth of the two organs under conditions of soil moisture depletion. The model simulation also showed that roots behave as reversibly leaky cable in water uptake. Some field data on root water extraction and vertical profiles of {$\Psi$} in shoots are viewed as manifestations of these basic phenomena. Also discussed is the trade-off between high xylem conductance and strong osmotic adjustment.},

  abstract = {Methods: We measured woody plant species abundance and a key functional trait associated with competition for resources and environmental tolerance (specific leaf area, SLA) along elevational gradients in low-latitude tropical (Costa Rica), mid-latitude desert (Arizona) and high latitude mediterranean (southern Oregon) biomes. We explored patterns of abiotic and biotic filtering by comparing observed patterns of community-weighted means and variances along elevational and latitudinal gradients to those expected under random assembly. In addition, we related trait variability to niches and explored how total trait space and breadth vary across broad spatial gradients by quantifying the ratio of intra- to inter-specific variation. Results: Both the community-wide mean and variance of SLA decreased with increasing latitude, consistent with greater abiotic filtering at higher latitudes. Further, low-elevation communities had higher trait variation than expected by chance, consistent with greater biotic filtering at low elevations. Finally, in the tropics and across latitude the ratio of intra- to inter-specific variation was negatively correlated to species richness, which further suggests that biotic interactions influence plant assembly at low latitudes. Conclusions: Intra- and inter-specific patterns of SLA variation appeared broadly consistent with the idea that the relative strength of biotic and abiotic drivers on community assembly changes along elevational and latitudinal gradients; evidence for biotic drivers appeared more prominent at low latitudes and elevations and evidence for abiotic drivers appeared more prominent at high latitudes and elevations.},

Based on coherent and time-resolved detection of the electric field of ultrashort radiation bursts in the far-infrared, this technique has become known as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). In this review article the authors describe the technique in its various implementations for static and time-resolved spectroscopy, and illustrate the performance of the technique with recent examples from solid-state physics and physical chemistry as well as aqueous chemistry. Examples from other fields of research, where THz spectroscopic techniques have proven to be useful research tools, and the potential for industrial applications of THz spectroscopic and imaging techniques are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the near infrared spectral region, a reflection plant water detection instrument was designed by using microcontroller STC12C5A60S2. The instrument consisted of signal acquisition system, microcontroller system, software system and calibration model. The signal acquisition system was composed of three LED of different wavelength and a light-to-frequency converter. Three LED of different wavelength were lighted by turns for avoiding interaction. Light-to-frequency converter was used as the receiving tube, thus simplifying the circuit structure greatly. This paper described the instrument's hardware design, software design, modeling of Forsythia leaf water content and forecasting. Predicted results were consistent with the true values of water, and the correlation coefficient between them was about 0.820. Advantages of this instrument were small, simple structure, low power consumption and so on. The experimental results showed that the instrument could detect plant water content rapidly on fieldwork.},

An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining LMA from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in LMA (33\textendash 262 g m\`A2; R2 = 0.94; P {$<$} 0.001). Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high LMA resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.},

On average across species, PLRC of 10\% occurred below turgor loss point and at a similar water status as 80\% stomatal closure. A compilation of PLRC data from the published literature showed strong variation across ecosystems, with ecosystems experiencing greater aridity in the growing season showing greater capacity to rehydrate. Our findings highlight leaf tissue desiccation tolerance as an adaptive trait and the importance of research establishing the mechanisms for leaf damage and resilience during and after drought.},

A major proportion of applied phosphate (Pi) fertilizers in the soil become fixed into insoluble, unavailable forms, which restricts crop production throughout the world. Roots possess two distinct modes of P uptake from the soil, direct and indirect uptake. The direct uptake of P is facilitated by the plant's own Pi transporters while indirect uptake occurs via mycorrhizal symbiosis, where the host plant obtains P primarily from the fungal partner, while the fungus benefits from plant-derived reduced carbon. So far, only one Pi transporter has been characterized from the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus versiforme. As arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi cannot be cultured axenically, their Pi transporter network is difficult to exploite for large scale sustainable agriculture. Alternatively, the root-colonizing endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica can grow axenically and provides strong growth-promoting activity during its symbiosis with a broad spectrum of plants. P. indica contains a high affinity Pi transporter (PiPT) involved in improving Pi nutrition levels in the host plant under P limiting conditions. As P. indica can be manipulated genetically, it opens new vistas to be used in P deficient fields.},

  abstract = {Carbon stock change due to forest management and disturbance must be accounted for in UNFCCC national inventory reports and for signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Impacts of disturbance on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are important for many countries with large forest estates prone to wildfires. Our objective was to measure changes in carbon stocks due to short-term combustion and to simulate longer-term carbon stock dynamics resulting from redistribution among biomass components following wildfire. We studied the impacts of a wildfire in 2009 that burnt temperate forest of tall, wet eucalypts in south-eastern Australia. Biomass combusted ranged from 40 to 58 tC ha-1, which represented 6\textendash 7\% and 9\textendash 14\% in low- and high-severity fire, respectively, of the pre-fire total biomass carbon stock. Pre-fire total stock ranged from 400 to 1040 tC ha-1 depending on forest age and disturbance history. An estimated 3.9 TgC was emitted from the 2009 fire within the forest region, representing 8.5\% of total biomass carbon stock across the landscape. Carbon losses from combustion were large over hours to days during the wildfire, but from an ecosystem dynamics perspective, the proportion of total carbon stock combusted was relatively small. Furthermore, more than half the stock losses from combustion were derived from biomass components with short lifetimes. Most biomass remained on-site, although redistributed from living to dead components. Decomposition of these components and new regeneration constituted the greatest changes in carbon stocks over ensuing decades. A critical issue for carbon accounting policy arises because the timeframes of ecological processes of carbon stock change are longer than the periods for reporting GHG inventories for national emissions reductions targets. Carbon accounts should be comprehensive of all stock changes, but reporting against targets should be based on human-induced changes in carbon stocks to incentivise mitigation activities.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of how solar radiation interacts with vegetation is necessary to interpret and process remote sensing data of agricultural and many natural resources. A plant leaf typically has a low reflectance in the visible spectral region because of strong absorption by chlorophylls, a relatively high reflectance in the near-infrared because of internal leaf scattering and no absorption, and a relatively low reflectance in the infrared beyond 1.3 \textasciitilde{} because of strong absorption by water. The reflectance of a plant canopy is similar, but is modified by the nonuniformity of incident solar radiation, plant structures, leaf areas, shadows, and background reflectivitics. Airborne sensors receive an integrated view of all these effects, and each crop or vegetation type tends to have a characteristic signature which permits its discrimination. When disease and physiological stresses directly affect the reflectance properties of individual leaves, the most pronounced initial changes often occur in the visible spectral region rather than in the infrared because of the sensitivity of chlorophyll to physiological disturbances. The primary basis for the detection of stress conditions in a crop or other plant community by aerial remote sensors often, however, is not a change in the reflectance characteristics of individual leaves, but a reduction in the total leaf area exposed to the sensors. This reduction can result from a direct loss of leaves, a change in their orientation, or an overall suppression of plant growth. In such eases the total infrared reflectance tends to be decreased relatively more than'the visible reflectance because of a reduction in the infrared enhancement due to fewer multiple leaf layers and because of an increase in background exposure.},

Since Mw depends on both plant water status and biomass, these observations have the potential to be useful for a range of plant drought response studies. In this paper, we introduce the principles behind microwave remote sensing observations to illustrate how they are sensitive to plant water content and discuss the relationship between landscape-scale Mw and common stand-scale metrics, including plant-scale relative water content, live fuel moisture content and leaf water potential. Lastly, we discuss how various sensor types can be leveraged for specific applications depending on the spatio-temporal resolution needed.},

  abstract = {Passive microwave measurements have the potential to estimate vegetation optical depth (VOD), an indicator of aboveground vegetation water content. They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve VOD and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the NASA Aquarius sensor. The global VOD distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved VOD is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The VOD and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band VOD and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to examine a technique for estimating the weight at full saturation (Ws) from pressure-volume (P-V) analysis of non-rehydrated plant tissue at various water deficits. Tissue samples are typically rehydrated prior to P-V analysis to determine Ws, necessary to calculate many tissue water parameters. However, several studies have indicated that artificial rehydration may significantly alter P-V relationships, such as the plateau effect, resulting in erroneous measurements of tissue elasticity and osmotic potentials. The results of this study suggest that linear regression of P-V data at and above the turgor loss point may be used to extrapolate Ws from non-rehydrated samples at various moisture deficits, thus eliminating the plateau effect and other potential rehydration problems. Determination coefficients and standard errors of the Y-intercept indicated a strong linear relationship between tissue fresh weight and water potential (?), and a high degree of predictability of Ws in all but one of the species-treatment combinations evaluated in this study, despite predawn ? as low as - 1.0 MPa.},

Current distributions of evergreen and deciduous tree species across local and regional moisture gradients reflect their ability to tolerate drought stress, and might be explained by functional traits. We measured leaf water potential at turgor loss (i.e. `wilting point'; {$\pi$}tlp), wood density (WD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) on 50 of the most abundant tree species in central Panama. We then tested their ability to explain distributions of evergreen and deciduous species within a 50 ha plot on Barro Colorado Island and across a 70 km rainfall gradient spanning the Isthmus of Panama. Among evergreen trees, species with lower {$\pi$}tlp were associated with drier habitats, with {$\pi$}tlp explaining 28\% and 32\% of habitat association on local and regional scales, respectively, greatly exceeding the predictive power of WD and LMA. In contrast, {$\pi$}tlp did not predict habitat associations among deciduous species. Across spatial scales, {$\pi$}tlp is a useful indicator of habitat preference for tropical tree species that retain their leaves during periods of water stress, and holds the potential to predict vegetation responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Mathematical analysis of the hydraulics of water movement through plant roots, in terms of radial and axial resistances, has led to equations which provide new insights into the effects of the component resistan ces on water uptake by and movement through individual roots and root systems. The ratio of axial to radial resistance determines the optimum length of a root and its total resistance to water movement. The equations permit direct calculations of the plant water potentials necessary, at the base of the plant, to sustain given flow rates through root systems with given characteristics. Lateral spacing and the resistance of individual laterals are the dominant factors determining total flux per unit area into a root.When soil water potential increases with depth (surface layers drier) root resistance tends to decrease with increasing flow rate; the reverse occurs when the surface is wetter than the lower layers. Calculated patterns of water movement into and through roots, in relation to soil water potential and flow rate through the root, indicate efflux from root to soil under certain conditions. This is considered to reflect reality, although the fluxes are probably transient or intermittent.The equations presented should be combined with equations describing water movement through soil to define the behaviour of the whole root-soil system adequately.}

  abstract = {Root turnover is an important carbon flux component in grassland ecosystems because it replenishes substantial parts of carbon lost from soil via heterotrophic respiration and leaching. Among the various methods to estimate root turnover, the root's radiocarbon signature has rarely been applied to grassland soils previously, although the value of this approach is known from studies in forest soils. In this paper, we utilize the root's radiocarbon signatures, at 25 plots, in mountain grasslands of the montane to alpine zone of Europe. We place the results in context of a global data base on root turnover and discuss driving factors. Root turnover rates were similar to those of a subsample of the global data, comprising a similar temperature range, but measured with different approaches, indicating that the radiocarbon method gives reliable, plausible and comparable results. Root turnover rates (0.06\textendash 1.0 y-1) scaled significantly and exponentially with mean annual temperatures. Root turnover rates indicated no trend with soil depth. The temperature sensitivity was significantly higher in mountain grassland, compared to the global data set, suggesting additional factors influencing root turnover. Information on management intensity from the 25 plots reveals that root turnover may be accelerated under intensive and moderate management compared to low intensity or semi-natural conditions. Because management intensity, in the studied ecosystems, co-varied with temperature, estimates on root turnover, based on mean annual temperature alone, may be biased. A greater recognition of management as a driver for root dynamics is warranted when effects of climatic change on belowground carbon dynamics are studied in mountain grasslands.},

  abstract = {Wheat is a major grain crop in China. Water is one of the most important factors which influence the lifecycle and yield of wheat. It is of great significance to study the water content at the key stages of wheat growth in order to make irrigation decision to raise its yield. As Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a brand new sensing technology and sensitive to water absorption, the relationship between terahertz spectra and water content in winter wheat leaf was investigated and a preliminary result was presented in this paper. Forty winter wheat leaves samples with diverse range of water content (42.8\%-72.5\%) were collected. The Terahertz time domain spectra (THz-TDS) were first obtained and then transformed into Frequency-domain amplitude with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method. The absorption and refractive index spectra were then calculated. The spectra were linearly fitted to obtain the slope and intercept used for building a calibration model. The partial least squares (PLS) method and linear regression were employed to establish models to determine leaf water content in the winter wheat. The predicted correlation coefficient and the root mean square error of the optimal model established with the Frequency-domain amplitude parameter at 0.3 THz by linear regression were 0.812\% and 4.4\%, respectively. The results showed that terahertz spectroscopy performed well in water content prediction and could be an effective and potential method for leaf water content measurement in winter wheat.},

We found a strong linear relationship between the sensitivity of tree-level transpiration estimated from sap flux (mT; slope of the relationship between tree transpiration and ln\hspace{0.25em}D) and transpiration at D\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}1\hspace{0.25em}kPa (ETref) that was similar to previous surveys of stomatal behavior in natural environments. In addition, mT was significantly related to vulnerability to cavitation of branches (P50). While mT did not appear to differ between ring- and diffuseporous species, the relationship between mT and P50 was distinct by wood anatomy. Therefore, our study confirms systematic differences in water relations in ring- versus diffuse-porous species, but these differences appear to be more strongly related to the relationship between stomatal sensitivity to D and vulnerability to cavitation rather than to stomatal sensitivity per se.},

We first trained the ANNs to predict evapotranspiration fraction (EF) based on the data at 28 AmeriFlux sites between 2003 and 2005. Five remotely-sensed variables including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ground-measured air temperature and wind velocity were used. The daily ET was calculated by multiplying net radiation flux derived from remote sensing products with EF. We then evaluated the model performance by comparing modeled ET with the data at 24 AmeriFlux sites in 2006. We found that the ANNs predicted daily ET well (R2 = 0.52\textendash 0.86). The ANNs were applied to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of daily ET for the conterminous U.S. in 2004 and 2005. The ecosystem WUE for the conterminous U.S. from 2004 to 2005 was calculated using MODIS GPP products (MOD17) and the estimated ET. We found that all ecosystems' WUE-drought relationships showed a two-stage pattern. Specifically, WUE increased when the intensity of drought was moderate; WUE tended to decrease under severe drought. These findings are consistent with the observations that WUE does not monotonously increase in response to water stress. Our study suggests a new water-use efficiency mechanism should be considered in ecosystem modeling. In addition, this study provides a high spatial and temporal resolution ET dataset, an important product for climate change and hydrological cycling studies for the MODIS era.},

The role of character trait divergences and network reorganization in the differentiation of the functional types in the megadiverse Neotropical Bromeliaceae was explored by quantifying a range of leaf economic and hydraulic traits in 50 diverse species. Functional types, which are defined by combinations of C3 or Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis, terrestrial or epiphytic habits, and non-specialized, tank-forming or atmospheric morphologies, segregated clearly in trait space. Most classical leaf economic relationships were supported, but they were weakened by the presence of succulence. Functional types differed in trait-network architecture, suggesting that rewiring of trait-networks caused by innovations in habit and photosynthetic pathway is an important aspect of ecological differentiation. The hydraulic data supported the coupling of leaf hydraulics and gas exchange, but not the hydraulic safety versus efficiency hypothesis, and hinted at an important role for the extra-xylary compartment in the control of bromeliad leaf hydraulics. Overall, our findings highlight the fundamental importance of structure\textendash function relationships in the generation and maintenance of ecological diversity.},

Leaf turgor loss point () was determined by a pressure-volume method for samples subjected to a hydration procedure and for untreated samples. Hydration caused to increase by as much as 3 M Pa. Hydration of samples also caused changes in other leaf water relations characteristics such as symplastic solute content, tissue elasticity and symplasmic water fraction, but total leaf solute content was unchanged. Comparison of our field plant water potential data with values of obtained by the two methods resulted in predictions of turgor loss during part or all of a diurnal cycle based on hydrated samples, and turgor maintenance (at least 0.3 MPa) based on untreated samples. Pooled data for obtained from both partially hydrated and untreated samples showed that L. tridentata maintains fairly constant levels of turgor over a wide range of leaf water potential. Dilution of cell contents by apoplastic water introduced significant errors in psychrometric determinations of osmotic potential in both frozen and thawed leaf tissue and expressed cell sap. Use of these values of osmotic potential resulted in predictions of zero turgor at all plant water potentials measured in the field.},

  abstract = {Salinity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate salinity induces hydraulic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a potentially critical role for physiological acclimation to salinity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates salinity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant hydraulic conductance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species with different salinity tolerances (Avicennia germinans L., Rhizophora mangle L. and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower salinity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four salinity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical salinity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic potential ({$\Psi$}s), stomatal conductance (gs), whole-plant hydraulic conductance (Kplant) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate water potentials ({$\Psi$}pdd). We expected that, for all three species, salinity increments would result in coordinated declines in {$\Psi$}s, gs and Kplant, and that the {$\Psi$}pdd would increase with substrate salinity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate water potential promoted a coordinated decline in {$\Psi$}s, gs and Kplant, whereas the {$\Psi$}pdd increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum salinity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute salinity stress via simultaneous reductions in {$\Psi$}s, gs and Kplant, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.},

  abstract = {* 1Although drought frequency and severity are predicted to increase across numerous continental interiors, the consequences of these changes for dominant plants are largely unknown. Over the last decade, the south-western US has experienced six drought years, including the extreme droughts of 1996 and 2002, which led to widespread tree mortality across northern Arizona. * 2We examined the impact of these droughts on the co-dominant tree species of the pinyon\textendash juniper woodland (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma), a major vegetation type in the US. * 3Pinyon mortality following both droughts was 6.5-fold higher than juniper mortality. In addition, large pinyons suffered 2\textendash 6-fold greater mortality than small pinyons, a pattern associated with higher mortality of reproductively mature trees and survival of smaller pinyons resulting from facilitation by established vegetation. Differential mortality of large pinyons resulted in a vegetation shift such that the pinyon\textendash juniper woodlands are becoming dominated by juniper, a species that is typical of lower elevations and more arid conditions. * 4Sites that experienced high pinyon mortality during the first drought suffered additional mortality during the second drought, so that reductions in tree densities and the resulting release from below-ground competition did not buffer surviving pinyons against additional mortality during the second drought. Such repeated mortality events also suggest that these stands may suffer chronic stress. * 5Reductions in biotic associations (e.g. avian seed dispersers, ectomycorrhizas and nurse plants) that will probably result from extreme mortality of large pinyons ensure that the observed vegetation shifts will be persistent. Because approximately 1000 species are associated with pinyon pine, the shift in the structure of these woodlands has large-scale community consequences.},

Moneymaker), chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L. cv. Amiga), grown in a hydroponic culture system. P deficiency strongly increased the net release of protons from roots of tomato, chickpea and white lupin, but only small effects were observed in wheat. Release of protons coincided with increased exudation of carboxylic acids in roots of chickpea and white lupin, but not in those of tomato and wheat. P deficiency-induced exudation of carboxylic acids in chickpea and white lupin was associated with a larger increase of carboxylic acid concentrations in the roots and lower accumulation of carboxylates in the shoot tissue compared to that in wheat and tomato. - Citric acid was one of the major organic acids accumulated in the roots of all investigated species in response to P deficiency, and this was associated with increased activity and enzyme protein levels of PEP carboxylase, which is required for biosynthesis of citrate. Accumulation of citric acid was most pronounced in the roots of P-deficient white lupin, chickpea and tomato. Increased PEP carboxylase activity in the roots of these plants coincided with decreased activity of aconitase, which is involved in the breakdown of citric acid in the TCA cycle. In the roots of P-deficient wheat plants, however, the activities of both PEP carboxylase and aconitase were enhanced, which was associated with little accumulation of citric acid. The results suggest that P deficiency-induced exudation of carboxylic acids depends on the ability to accumulate carboxylic acids in the root tissue, which in turn is determined by biosynthesis, degradation and partitioning of carboxylic acids or related precursors between roots and shoot. In some plant species such as white lupin, there are indications for a specific transport mechanism (anion channel), involved in root exudation of extraordinary high amounts of citric acid.},

Britton \& Rose and Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller. Responses were similar for the two species but varied for the three root ages. Drying in soil for 30 d caused little change in Lp or internal structure for 1-month-old roots, primarily due to the formation of soil sheaths in the root hair zone. For 3-month-o!d roots, Ly declined three- to five-fold after 30 d of dr{$>$}'ing, partly because of lacunae caused by rupture of cortical cells. For 12-month-oId roots after 30 d of drying, the dehydration of suberized periderma! layers led to a two- to three-fold decline in Lp. Measurements of axia! hydraulic conductance per unit pressure gradient (K"u) before and after pressurization indicated that air embolism, caused by 30 d of drying, decreased K"\^ by 53, 97, and 98 '\textbackslash, for 1 -, 3- and 12-month-old roots, respectively. Rewetting after 30 d of dr\textbackslash -ing restored K\^ to initial values within 7 d for all three root ages. Lp after rewetting attained 100 \textdegree,, of its initial value for ] -month-old roots and about 6 0 \% for 3- and 12-month-old roots. The formation of soil sheaths around young roots, the reduction in radia] conductivity for older roots by cortical lacunae and peridermal dehydration, and the reduction in K\^ by embolism thus caused a moderate, partly reversible decline in L,, that can help limit water loss from roots to the soil during drought.},

  abstract = {Epiphytic plants in the Bromeliaceae known as tank bromeliads essentially lack stems and absorptive roots and instead take up water from reservoirs formed by their overlapping leaf bases. For such plants, leaf hydraulic conductance is plant hydraulic conductance. Their simple strap-shaped leaves and parallel venation make them suitable for modeling leaf hydraulic conductance based on vasculature and other anatomical and morphological traits. Plants of the tank bromeliad Guzmania lingulata were investigated in a lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica and a shaded glasshouse in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Stomatal conductance to water vapor and leaf anatomical variables related to hydraulic conductance were measured for both groups. Tracheid diameters and numbers of vascular bundles (veins) were used with the Hagen\textendash Poiseuille equation to calculate axial hydraulic conductance. Measurements of leaf hydraulic conductance using the evaporative flux method were also made for glasshouse plants. Values for axial conductance and leaf hydraulic conductance were used in a model based on leaky cable theory to estimate the conductance of the radial pathway from the vein to the leaf surface and to assess the relative contributions of both axial and radial pathways. In keeping with low stomatal conductance, low stomatal density, low vein density, and narrow tracheid diameters, leaf hydraulic conductance for G. lingulata was quite low in comparison with most other angiosperms. Using the predicted axial conductance in the leaky cable model, the radial resistance across the leaf mesophyll was predicted to predominate; lower, more realistic values of axial conductance resulted in predicted radial resistances that were closer to axial resistance in their impact on total leaf resistance. Tracer dyes suggested that water uptake through the tank region of the leaf was not limiting. Both dye movement and the leaky cable model indicated that the leaf blade of G. lingulata was structurally and hydraulically well-suited to conserve water.},

Root hydraulic conductivity ( LP ) and axial conductance ( Kh ) were measured for intact root segments from the distal region with an endodermis and from midroot with a periderm; LP was then measured for each segment with successive tissues removed by dissection. Radial conductivity ( LR ) was calculated from LP and Kh for the intact segment and for the individual tissues by considering the tissue conductivities in series. Under wet conditions, LR for intact distal root segments was lowest for the cortex; at midroot, where cortical cells are dead, LR for the cortex was higher and no single tissue was the predominant limiter of LR . LR for the endodermis and the periderm were similar under wet conditions. During 30d of soil drying, LR for the distal cortex increased almost three-fold due to the death of cortical cells, whereas LR for the midroot cortex was unaffected; LR for the endodermis and the periderm decreased by 40 and 90\%, respectively, during drying. For both root regions under wet conditions, the vascular cylinder had the highest LR , which decreased by 50\textendash 70\% during 30d of soil drying. After 3d of rewetting, new lateral roots emerged, increasing LR for the tissues outside the vascular cylinder as well as increasing uptake of an apoplastic tracer into the xylem of both the roots and the shoot. The average LR for intact root segments was similar under wet and rewetted conditions, but the conductivity of the tissues outside the vascular cylinder increased after rewetting, as did the contribution of the apoplastic pathway to water uptake.}

Mez and Guzmania monostachia (L.) Rusby ex Mez. They occur sympatrically at the study site, although G. monostachia is both wider ranging and typically found in higher light. We collected plants from two levels of irradiance and measured Kleaf as well as related morphological and anatomical traits. Leaf xylem conductance (Kxy) was estimated from tracheid dimensions, and leaf conductance outside the xylem (Kox) was derived from a leaky cable model. For G. monostachia, but not for G. lingulata, Kleaf and Kxy were significantly higher in high light conditions. Under both light conditions, Kxy and Kox were co-limiting for the two species, and all conductances were in the low range for angiosperms. With respect to hydraulic conductances and a number of related anatomical traits, G. monostachia exhibited greater plasticity than did G. lingulata, which responded to high light chiefly by reducing leaf size. The positive plasticity of leaf hydraulic traits in varying light environments in G. monostachia contrasted with negative plasticity in leaf size for G. lingulata, suggesting that G. monostachia may be better able to respond to forest conditions that are likely to be warmer and more disturbed in the future.},

However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

Various methodological tools exist to analyze the resulting allocation patterns, based either on the calculation of biomass ratios or fractions of different organs at a given point in time, or on a so-called allometric analysis of biomass data sampled across species or over an experimental growth period. We discuss the weak and strong points of each of these methods. Although both approaches have useful features, we suggest that often a plot of biomass fractions against total plant size, either across species or in the comparison of treatment effects, combines the best of both worlds.},

  abstract = {The land and ocean act as a sink for fossil-fuel emissions, thereby slowing the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Although the uptake of carbon by oceanic and terrestrial processes has kept pace with accelerating carbon dioxide emissions until now, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations exhibit a large variability on interannual timescales, considered to be driven primarily by terrestrial ecosystem processes dominated by tropical rainforests. We use a terrestrial biogeochemical model, atmospheric carbon dioxide inversion and global carbon budget accounting methods to investigate the evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink over the past 30 years, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the exceptionally large land carbon sink reported in 2011 (ref. 2). Here we show that our three terrestrial carbon sink estimates are in good agreement and support the finding of a 2011 record land carbon sink. Surprisingly, we find that the global carbon sink anomaly was driven by growth of semi-arid vegetation in the Southern Hemisphere, with almost 60 per cent of carbon uptake attributed to Australian ecosystems, where prevalent La Ni\~na conditions caused up to six consecutive seasons of increased precipitation. In addition, since 1981, a six per cent expansion of vegetation cover over Australia was associated with a fourfold increase in the sensitivity of continental net carbon uptake to precipitation. Our findings suggest that the higher turnover rates of carbon pools in semi-arid biomes are an increasingly important driver of global carbon cycle inter-annual variability and that tropical rainforests may become less relevant drivers in the future. More research is needed to identify to what extent the carbon stocks accumulated during wet years are vulnerable to rapid decomposition or loss through fire in subsequent years.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Shrubs in fire prone chaparral communities have evolved different life history types in response to fire. A key to understanding the evolution of life history type differences is to understand how physiological traits are linked to differences in life history type. Vascular adaptations are important for delivering an efficient and stable water supply to evergreen chaparral shrub leaves. This study tested for a link between vascular physiology and life history type in chaparral shrubs. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Chaparral shrub species along the south-western coast of North America survive wildfire by three different life histories. Non-sprouters are killed by fire and re-establish exclusively through germination of fire-stimulated seeds, facultative sprouters re-establish by a combination of vegetative sprouting and fire-stimulated seeds, and obligate sprouters re-establish exclusively by vegetative sprouting because their seeds do not survive fire. Non-sprouters and facultative sprouters establish seedlings in the open canopy post fire environment, whereas obligate sprouters establish seedlings in the shady understory of the mature chaparral canopy. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Seedlings of nine species (Rhamnaceae) representing three each of the different life history types were grown in deep containers in a common garden under treatments of sun and shade. Hydraulic conductance was measured using a high-pressure flow meter for all organs, and a vacuum technique was used to measure conductance of fine and woody roots. We predicted that non-sprouters would exhibit greater hydraulic efficiency than the sprouting species, and that facultative sprouters would be more efficient than the shade tolerant obligate sprouters. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Non-sprouters had the greatest hydraulic conductance per unit leaf and sapwood area at the whole seedling level, whereas facultative and obligate sprouters were not different. Comparing hydraulic conductance across major organs (from fine roots to leaves) showed that the hydraulic system was well coordinated. At the whole seedling level, the root system was more of a bottleneck than the shoot system. This pattern was consistent with high resistance extraxylary pathways in roots and differences in root architecture. 5.\hspace{0.6em}The greater hydraulic efficiency of the non-sprouter life history type is attributed to its post-fire pioneering habit and may partially explain the relatively high speciation in the non-sprouters. Lower hydraulic efficiency is associated with a sprouting life history and greater shade tolerance. The seedling root systems represent a hydraulic bottleneck that may place roots under especially intense selection.},

In this study, terahertz (THz) and visible range spectra of chlorophyll a and {$\beta$}-carotene and their changes under light treatment were investigated. The results show that the all THz transmission and absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and {$\beta$}-carotene changed upon light treatment, with the maximum changes at 15 min of illumination indicating the greatest changes of the collective vibrational mode of chlorophyll a and {$\beta$}-carotene. The absorption spectra of chlorophyll a in the visible light region decreased upon light treatment, signifying the degradation of chlorophyll a molecules. It can be inferred from these results that the THz spectra are very sensitive in monitoring the changes of the collective vibrational mode, despite the absence of changes in molecular configuration. The THz spectra can therefore be used to monitor the decomposing process of biological macromolecules; however, visible absorption spectra can only be used to monitor the breakdown extent of biological macromolecules.}

  abstract = {Young secondary forests and plantations in the moist tropics often have rapid rates of biomass accumulation and thus sequester large amounts of carbon. Here, we compare results from mature forest and nearby 15\textendash 20 year old tree plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate differences in allocation of carbon to aboveground production and root systems. We found that the tree plantations, which had fully developed, closed canopies, allocated more carbon belowground - to their root systems - than did mature forest. This increase in belowground carbon allocation correlated significantly with aboveground tree growth but not with canopy production (i.e., leaf fall or fine litter production). In contrast, there were no correlations between canopy production and either tree growth or belowground carbon allocation. Enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake, providing nutrients beyond those required for the production of short-lived tissues such as leaves and fine roots, and thus enabling biomass accumulation. Our analyses support this deduction at our site, showing that enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can be an important mechanism promoting biomass accumulation during forest growth in the moist tropics. Identifying factors that control when, where and for how long this occurs would help us to improve models of forest growth and nutrient cycling, and to ascertain the role that young forests play in mitigating increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality events are expected to increase in frequency under climate change. However, monitoring and modeling of tree mortality is limited by the high spatial variability in vegetation response to climatic drought stress and lack of physiologically meaningful stress variables that can be monitored at large scales. In this study, we test the hypothesis that relative water content (RWC) estimated by passive microwave remote sensing through vegetation optical depth can be used as an empirical indicator of tree mortality that both integrates variations in plant drought stress and is accessible across large areas. The hypothesis was tested in a recent severe drought in California, USA. The RWC showed a stronger threshold relationship with mortality than climatic water deficit (CWD) \textendash{} a commonly used mortality indicator \textendash{} although both relationships were noisy due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data (0.25\textdegree{} or approximately 25 km). In addition, the threshold for RWC was more uniform than that for CWD when compared between Northern and Southern regions of California. A random forests regression (machine learning) with 32 variables describing topography, climate, and vegetation characteristics predicted forest mortality extent i.e. fractional area of mortality (FAM) with satisfactory accuracy-coefficient of determination Rtest2 = 0.66, root mean square error = 0.023. Importantly, RWC was more than twice as important as any other variable in the model in estimating mortality, confirming its strong link to mortality rates. Moreover, RWC showed a moderate ability to aid in forecasting mortality, with a relative importance of RWC measured one year in advance of mortality similar to that of other relevant explanatory variables measured in the mortality year.

  abstract = {Physiological measurements are considered to be the most accurate way of assessing plant water status, but they might also be time-consuming, costly and intrusive. Since visible (VIS)-to-shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging spectrometers are able to monitor various bio-chemical alterations in the leaf, such narrow-band instruments may offer a faster, less expensive and non-destructive alternative. This requires an intelligent downsizing of broad and noisy hyperspectra into the few most physiologically-sensitive wavelengths. In the current study, hyperspectral signatures of water-stressed grapevine leaves (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were correlated to values of midday leaf water potential (Wl), stomatal conductance (gs) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under controlled conditions, using the partial least squares-regression (PLS-R) technique. It was found that opposite reflectance trends at 530\textendash 550 nm and around 1500 nm \textendash{} associated with independent changes in photoprotective pigment contents and water availability, respectively \textendash{} were indicative of stress-induced alterations in Wl, gs and NPQ. Furthermore, combining the spectral responses at these VIS and SWIR regions yielded three normalized water balance indices (WABIs), which were superior to various widely-used reflectance models in predicting physiological values at both the leaf and canopy levels. The potential of the novel WABI formulations also under field conditions demonstrates their applicability for water status monitoring and irrigation scheduling.},

  abstract = {Summary The capacity of plant species to resist xylem cavitation is an important determinant of resistance to drought, mortality thresholds, geographic distribution and productivity. Unravelling the role of xylem cavitation vulnerability in plant evolution and adaptation requires a clear understanding of how this key trait varies between the tissues of individuals and between individuals of species. Here, we examine questions of variation within individuals by measuring how cavitation moves between organs of individual plants. Using multiple cameras placed simultaneously on roots, stems and leaves, we were able to record systemic xylem cavitation during drying of individual olive plants. Unlike previous studies, we found a consistent pattern of root~{$>~$}stem~{$>~$}leaf in terms of xylem resistance to cavitation. The substantial variation in vulnerability to cavitation, evident among individuals, within individuals and within tissues of olive seedlings, was coordinated such that plants with more resistant roots also had more resistant leaves. Preservation of root integrity means that roots can continue to supply water for the regeneration of drought?damaged aerial tissues after post?drought rain. Furthermore, coordinated variation in vulnerability between leaf, stem and root in olive plants suggests a strong selective pressure to maintain a fixed order of cavitation during drought.},

  abstract = {AbstractLeaves are extraordinarily variable in form, longevity, venation architecture, and capacity for photosynthetic gas exchange. Much of this diversity is linked with water transport capacity. The pathways through the leaf constitute a substantial ({$\geq$}30\%) part of the resistance to water flow through plants, and thus influence rates of transpiration and photosynthesis. Leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) varies more than 65-fold across species, reflecting differences in the anatomy of the petiole and the venation architecture, as well as pathways beyond the xylem through living tissues to sites of evaporation. Kleaf is highly dynamic over a range of time scales, showing circadian and developmental trajectories, and responds rapidly, often reversibly, to changes in temperature, irradiance, and water supply. This review addresses how leaf structure and physiology influence Kleaf, and the mechanisms by which Kleaf contributes to dynamic functional responses at the level of both individual leaves and the whole plant.},

  abstract = {The southernmost European natural and planted pine forests are among the most vulnerable areas to warming-induced drought decline. Both drought stress and management factors (e.g., stand origin or reduced thinning) may induce decline by reducing the water available to trees but their relative importances have not been properly assessed. The role of stand origin \textendash{} densely planted vs. naturally regenerated stands \textendash{} as a decline driver can be assessed by comparing the growth and vigor responses to drought of similar natural vs. planted stands. Here, we compare these responses in natural and planted Black pine (Pinus nigra) stands located in southern Spain. We analyze how environmental factors \textendash{} climatic (temperature and precipitation anomalies) and site conditions \textendash{} and biotic factors \textendash{} stand structure (age, tree size, density) and defoliation by the pine processionary moth \textendash{} drive radial growth and crown condition at stand and tree levels. We also assess the climatic trends in the study area over the last 60 years. We use dendrochronology, linear mixed-effects models of basal area increment and structural equation models to determine how natural and planted stands respond to drought and current competition intensity. We observed that a temperature rise and a decrease in precipitation during the growing period led to increasing drought stress during the late 20th century. Trees from planted stands experienced stronger growth reductions and displayed more severe crown defoliation after severe droughts than those from natural stands. High stand density negatively drove growth and enhanced crown dieback, particularly in planted stands. Also pine processionary moth defoliation was more severe in the growth of natural than in planted stands but affected tree crown condition similarly in both stand types. In response to drought, sharp growth reduction and widespread defoliation of planted Mediterranean pine stands indicate that they are more vulnerable and less resilient to drought stress than natural stands. To mitigate forest decline of planted stands in xeric areas such as the Mediterranean Basin, less dense and more diverse stands should be created through selective thinning or by selecting species or provenances that are more drought tolerant.},

  abstract = {In this study the estimation of reflectivity at 1730 MHz (l-band), measured with a microwave digital cordless telephony (DCT) patch antenna, is presented as an easy-to-handle and non-destructive new method to assess the relative water content (RWC) of poplar leaves and filter discs at different levels of dehydration. The accuracy of this new method has been contrasted with the R1300/R1450 index, determined by a portable near infrared (NIR) spectrometer. The close correlations found between RWC and the reflectivity at a frequency of 1730 MHz, both for filters and leaves, indicate that microwave determinations are rather independent of the physical properties of the material analysed. On the contrary, the differences found between poplar leaves and leaf filters in the relationships established between RWC and the R1300/R1450 index demonstrate a strong influence of the properties of the material in NIR reflectance measurements, specifically as they relate to changes in leaf thickness during dehydration. It should be noted that the amount of energy received by the leaf for the microwave technique (0.1 mW) was much lower than that received for the measuring of the R1300/R1450 index (2.5 W). Moreover, R-square coefficients were higher for microwaves than for the R1300/R1450 index. The use of a technologically simple, low cost and portable device, based on a microwave DCT patch antenna, could yield a solid support for the development of a commercial apparatus enabling the determination of plant water status under field conditions.},

Proper irrigation management requires reliable information on plant water status, but all the plant-based methods to determine it suffer from several inconveniences, mainly caused by the necessity of destructive sampling or of alteration of the plant organ due to contact installation. The aim of this work is to test if terahertz (THz) time domain reflectance measurements made on the grapevine trunk allows contactless monitoring of plant status. The experiments were performed on a potted 14-years-old plant, using a general purpose THz emitter receiver head. Trunk THz time-domain reflection signal proved to be very sensitive to changes in plant water availability, as its pattern follows the trend of soil water content and trunk growth variations. Therefore, it could be used to contactless monitor plant water status. Apart from that, THz reflection signal was observed to respond to light conditions which, according to a specifically designed girdling experiment, was caused by changes in the phloem. This latter results opens a promising field of research for contactless monitoring of phloem activity.},

Fourier Transform-Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a cost-effective and rapid analytical tool with potential beyond its current use in plant physiology. We tested the use of FTIR spectroscopy as a method for estimating wood density (WD) and xylem resistance to embolism formation (P50) in 24 angiosperm species. Higher WD was associated with more negative P50 (r2 = 0.41). Partial least squares regression was applied to establish models of FTIR spectra and the reference data. They showed a high predictive quality for WD (r2 = 0.73), whereas the prediction of P50 was weaker (r2 = 0.49). By including WD in the model as an additional factor influencing P50, its predictive power significantly increased (r2 = 0.59). The spectral range in the model elaboration has been also narrowed (bands of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose), but this did not influence the model descriptors, suggesting that for P50 prediction broad spectral range is more informative than narrow band regions reflecting main wood constituents. In conclusion, FTIR spectroscopy associated with WD measurements has proven to be a promising alternative to traditional methods for screening of individual- or species-specific resistance to embolism in angiosperms.}

  abstract = {Feedbacks from the terrestrial carbon cycle significantly affect future climate change. The CO2 concentration dependence of global terrestrial carbon storage is one of the largest and most uncertain feedbacks. Theory predicts the CO2 effect should have a tropical maximum, but a large terrestrial sink has been contradicted by analyses of atmospheric CO2 that do not show large tropical uptake. Our results, however, show significant tropical uptake and, combining tropical and extratropical fluxes, suggest that up to 60\% of the present-day terrestrial sink is caused by increasing atmospheric CO2. This conclusion is consistent with a validated subset of atmospheric analyses, but uncertainty remains. Improved model diagnostics and new space-based observations can reduce the uncertainty of tropical and temperate zone carbon flux estimates. This analysis supports a significant feedback to future atmospheric CO2 concentrations from carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems caused by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This feedback will have substantial tropical contributions, but the magnitude of future carbon uptake by tropical forests also depends on how they respond to climate change and requires their protection from deforestation.},

  abstract = {A recent study found that cutting shoots under water while xylem was under tension (which has been the standard protocol for the past few decades) could produce artefactual embolisms inside the xylem, overestimating hydraulic vulnerability relative to shoots cut under water after relaxing xylem tension (Wheeler et al. 2013). That study also raised the possibility that such a `Wheeler effect' might occur in studies of leaf hydraulic vulnerability. We tested for such an effect for four species by applying a modified vacuum pump method to leaves with minor veins severed, to construct leaf xylem hydraulic vulnerability curves. We tested for an impact on leaf xylem hydraulic conductance (Kx) of cutting the petiole and minor veins under water for dehydrated leaves with xylem under tension compared with dehydrated leaves after previously relaxing xylem tension. Our results showed no significant `cutting artefact' for leaf xylem. The lack of an effect for leaves could not be explained by narrower or shorter xylem conduits, and may be due to lesser mechanical stress imposed when cutting leaf petioles, and/or to rapid refilling of emboli in petioles. These findings provide the first validation of previous measurements of leaf hydraulic vulnerability against this potential artefact.},

  abstract = {Resolving the drivers of hydraulic decline during drought is crucial for understanding drought tolerance in crops and natural ecosystems. In the past 15 years, studies of the decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) have supported a major role in controlling plant drought responses. We analyzed the variation in Kleaf decline with dehydration in a global database of 310 species, providing novel insights into its underlying mechanisms, its co-ordination with stem hydraulics, its influence on gas exchange and drought tolerance, and its linkage with species ecological distributions. Kleaf vulnerability varied strongly within and across lineages, growth forms, and biomes. A critical literature review indicates that changes in hydraulic conductance outside the xylem with dehydration drive the overall decline of Kleaf. We demonstrate a significant leaf hydraulic safety\textendash efficiency trade-off across angiosperm species and discuss the importance of the large variation around this trend. Leaves tend to be more vulnerable than stems, with their vulnerabilities co-ordinated across species, and importantly linked with adaptation across biomes. We hypothesize a novel framework to explain diversity across species in the co-ordination of Kleaf and gas exchange during dehydration. These findings reflect considerable recent progress, yet new tools for measurement, visualization, and modeling will result in ongoing discoveries important across fields in plant biology.},

  abstract = {Across plant species, leaves vary enormously in their size and their venation architecture, of which one major function is to replace water lost to transpiration. The leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)) represents the capacity of the transport system to deliver water, allowing stomata to remain open for photosynthesis. Previous studies showed that K(leaf) relates to vein density (vein length per area). Additionally, venation architecture determines the sensitivity of K(leaf) to damage; severing the midrib caused K(leaf) and gas exchange to decline, with lesser impacts in leaves with higher major vein density that provided more numerous water flow pathways around the damaged vein. Because xylem embolism during dehydration also reduces K(leaf), we hypothesized that higher major vein density would also reduce hydraulic vulnerability. Smaller leaves, which generally have higher major vein density, would thus have lower hydraulic vulnerability. Tests using simulations with a spatially explicit model confirmed that smaller leaves with higher major vein density were more tolerant of major vein embolism. Additionally, for 10 species ranging strongly in drought tolerance, hydraulic vulnerability, determined as the leaf water potential at 50\% and 80\% loss of K(leaf), was lower with greater major vein density and smaller leaf size (|r| = 0.85\textendash 0.90; P {$<$} 0.01). These relationships were independent of other aspects of physiological and morphological drought tolerance. These findings point to a new functional role of venation architecture and small leaf size in drought tolerance, potentially contributing to well-known biogeographic trends in leaf size.}

These findings were tested and extended, using a new steady-state evaporative flux method under high irradiance, and the function for the vulnerability curve of each species was determined individually using maximum likelihood for 10 species varying strongly in drought tolerance. Additionally, the ability of excised leaves to recover in Kleaf with rehydration was assessed, and a new theoretical framework was developed to estimate how rehydration of measured leaves may affect estimation of hydraulic parameters. As hypothesized, species differed in their vulnerability function. Drought-tolerant species showed shallow linear declines and more negative {$\Psi$}leaf at 80\% loss of Kleaf (P80), whereas drought-sensitive species showed steeper, non-linear declines, and less negative P80. Across species, the maximum Kleaf was independent of hydraulic vulnerability. Recovery of Kleaf after 1 h rehydration of leaves dehydrated below their turgor loss point occurred only for four of 10 species. Across species without recovery, a more negative P80 correlated with the ability to maintain Kleaf through both dehydration and rehydration.

This effect has been proposed to contribute to the control of plant hydraulic and stomatal conductance and potentially to influence on carbon balance during dehydration. However, this effect has never been directly tested for leaf xylem, which constitutes a major bottleneck in the whole plant. We tested for an ion-mediated increase in the hydraulic conductance of the leaf xylem (Kx) for seven species diverse in phylogeny and drought tolerance. Across species, no significant changes in Kx were observed between 0 and 15 mM KCl. We further tested for an effect of ion solution during measurements of Kx vulnerability to dehydration in Quercus agrifolia and found no significant impact. These results for leaf xylem contrast with the often strong ion effect reported for stems, and we suggest several hypotheses to account for the difference, relating to the structure of xylem conduits across vein orders, and the ultrastructure of leaf xylem pores. A negligible ion response in leaves would weaken xylem sap ion-mediated control of plant hydraulic conductance, facilitating modeling of whole plant hydraulic behavior and its influence on productivity.},

  abstract = {The geographic ranges of closely related species can vary dramatically, yet we do not fully grasp the mechanisms underlying such variation. The niche breadth hypothesis posits that species that have evolved broad environmental tolerances can achieve larger geographic ranges than species with narrow environmental tolerances. In turn, plasticity and genetic variation in ecologically important traits and adaptation to environmentally variable areas can facilitate the evolution of broad environmental tolerance. We used five pairs of western North American monkeyflowers to experimentally test these ideas by quantifying performance across eight temperature regimes. In four species pairs, species with broader thermal tolerances had larger geographic ranges, supporting the niche breadth hypothesis. As predicted, species with broader thermal tolerances also had more within-population genetic variation in thermal reaction norms and experienced greater thermal variation across their geographic ranges than species with narrow thermal tolerances. Species with narrow thermal tolerance may be particularly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions due to lack of plasticity and insufficient genetic variation to respond to novel selection pressures. Conversely, species experiencing high variation in temperature across their ranges may be buffered against extinction due to climatic changes because they have evolved tolerance to a broad range of temperatures.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

  abstract = {Climate change is governed by changes to the global energy balance. At the top of the atmosphere, this balance is monitored globally by satellite sensors that provide measurements of energy flowing to and from Earth. By contrast, observations at the surface are limited mostly to land areas. As a result, the global balance of energy fluxes within the atmosphere or at Earth's surface cannot be derived directly from measured fluxes, and is therefore uncertain. This lack of precise knowledge of surface energy fluxes profoundly affects our ability to understand how Earth's climate responds to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. In light of compilations of up-to-date surface and satellite data, the surface energy balance needs to be revised. Specifically, the longwave radiation received at the surface is estimated to be significantly larger, by between 10 and 17 Wm-2, than earlier model-based estimates. Moreover, the latest satellite observations of global precipitation indicate that more precipitation is generated than previously thought. This additional precipitation is sustained by more energy leaving the surface by evaporation \textemdash{} that is, in the form of latent heat flux \textemdash{} and thereby offsets much of the increase in longwave flux to the surface.},

  abstract = {The terahertz band lies between the microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation has very low photon energy and thus it does not pose any ionization hazard for biological tissues. It is strongly attenuated by water and very sensitive to water content. Unique absorption spectra due to intermolecular vibrations in this region have been found in different biological materials. These unique features make terahertz imaging very attractive for medical applications in order to provide complimentary information to existing imaging techniques. There has been an increasing interest in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy of biologically related applications within the last few years and more and more terahertz spectra are being reported. This paper introduces terahertz technology and provides a short review of recent advances in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy techniques, and a number of applications such as molecular spectroscopy, tissue characterization and skin imaging are discussed.},

We have employed a new experimental technique based on ultrashort electromagnetic pulses (THz pulses). This technique allows for fast and reliable data of both index of refraction and absorption coefficient for highly absorbing liquids. The temperature dependence reveals an enthalpy of activation corresponding to 2.5 kcal/mol, in agreement with recent Raman experiments, but lower than the enthalpy observed in dielectric relaxation experiments. This demonstrates that part of the orientational relaxation in liquid water takes place without breaking of hydrogen bonds with bonding energy of 5 kcal/mol, as suggested in recent theoretical model.},

  abstract = {To determine the resilience of soil organic C and N pools during land degradation processes in a semi-arid landscape of West Africa, we compared the magnitude of soil organic C and N differences in bulk soil and aggregate fractions between contrasting types of land cover (degraded land and native land cover) and soil (Luvisols and Cambisols). We analyzed the following soil key indicators: CEC, soil respiration, C and N contents, and {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N signatures of soil organic C. The average CO2 respired from native land cover was at least 82\% higher than its value from degraded land cover and was significantly higher in Luvisols than in Cambisols. Likewise, the soil organic C and N contents in bulk soil were significantly affected by land cover and soil contrasts. The average C loss in bulk soil from degraded land cover was equivalent to 49\% in Cambisols and 54\% in Luvisols. In both soil types, all aggregate fractions were sensitive to land degradation processes and the C loss decreased from macroaggregates to the clay + silt fraction. Compared to the native land cover, organic C loss from the macroaggregates in degraded land cover was 92\% and 84\%, respectively, in Cambisols and Luvisols. The soil type affected significantly the C content only in the clay + silt fraction. The C/N ratio of finer fractions (microaggregates and clay + silt) was significantly higher in degraded land cover than in native land cover, indicating greater losses of N than C during land degradation processes. The differences of {$\delta$}13C signatures throughout C pools between the two types of land cover suggest a relative dominance of C3 derived C in macroaggregates and C4 derived C in the clay + silt fraction in the degraded lands. The reduction of soil respiration and the rapid N loss in degraded land cover slowed down the humification processes of C3 plant derived materials which were effectively dominant in macroaggregates.},

We assessed dehydration-induced losses of rehydration capacity and maximum quantum yield of the photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in the leaves of 10 diverse angiosperm species, and tested when these occurred relative to turgor loss, declines of stomatal conductance gs, and hydraulic conductance Kleaf, including xylem and outside xylem pathways for the same study plants. We resolved the sequences of relative water content and leaf water potential ?leaf thresholds of functional impairment. On average, losses of leaf rehydration capacity occurred at dehydration beyond 50\% declines of gs, Kleaf and turgor loss point. Losses of Fv/Fm occurred after much stronger dehydration and were not recovered with leaf rehydration. Across species, tissue dehydration thresholds were intercorrelated, suggesting trait co-selection. Thresholds for each type of functional decline were much less variable across species in terms of relative water content than ?leaf. The stomatal and leaf hydraulic systems show early functional declines before cell integrity is lost. Substantial damage to the photochemical apparatus occurs at extreme dehydration, after complete stomatal closure, and seems to be irreversible.},

The data were plotted either as {$\Psi$} versus 1/R* or as 1/{$\Psi$} versus R* and analysed by linear regression in the region where cell turgor was thought to be zero. In some cases the {$\Psi$} versus 1/R* transformation showed curvature in the zero turgor region whereas less curvature was found in the same region of R* in the 1/{$\Psi$} versus R* transformation. In theory, curvature can appear in the {$\Psi$} versus 1/R* transformation whenever a significant fraction of tissue water is contained in the apoplast, and this theoretical prediction can be demonstrated by some of the data in this paper. The presence or absence of curvature in the two transformations can also be due to (1) apoplast compressibility, (2) the development of negative turgor pressure in living cells, and (3) the nonideality of the osmotic solutions in living cells. Linear regressions performed on curved data plots will lead to errors in the estimation of {$\pi$}               0               , the osmotic pressure at full hydration, and of other parameters derived from the analysis.},

Two types of transformations are usually considered: \textbackslash/Y versus R* and Y versus l/R*, and linear regression is used to fit the data in the region where turgor is thought to be zero. It appears that when TI\^ is estimated by linear extrapolation of 1/V versus R* then apoplastic water might not influence the accuracy of 7\^; but when the Y versus MR* transformation is used apoplastic water causes an underestimate of it,,. We examine the accuracy of the estimate of n\^ obtained from the two transformations when there are random errors in n, systematic errors in n, and when the osmotic solutions are non-ideal. The \textbackslash/Y versus R* transformation generally produces the best estimate of h0 by linear extrapolation.},

The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even tbe maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) tbe vulnerabihty of stems to droughtinduced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

Our theoretical analysis suggests that the `pressure-volume curve' can be related quantitatively to meaningful bulk parameters of water relations: viz. the total osmolar content of the symplast Ns, the original volume of the symplast Vo, the volume expressed from the symplast Ve, the gas-pressure of the bomb P, and the volume-averaged turgor pressure (the sum of the products of the relative volume and turgor pressure of each cell). An empirical relation for the volume-averaged turgor pressure of twigs is found which fits all species examined; it also fits the turgor pressure relation for single (Nitella) cells.}

The second edition opens with the three-dimensional aspects of wood anatomy. The cohesion-tension theory and new evidence are introduced in response to recent controversies over the mechanism of sap ascent in plants. The physiology, anatomy and biophysics of xylem dysfunction are discussed and new insights into hydraulic architecture are reviewed with special emphasis on physiological limits on maximum transpiration and how hydraulic architecture limits gas exchange, carbon gain and growth of plants. The text concludes with a description of xylem failure and pathology. The book highlights fascinating areas of current research with the aim to stimulate more work in the future.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

The 1984 MAPS data are also compared with tropospheric ozone concentrations derived from 6 years of TOMS and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) I and II measurements. Examination of the October climatological distribution of tropospheric ozone also reveals high concentrations over central South America and southeastern Africa. These coincident high values of CO and ozone in the rural southern tropics are most likely due to biomass burning and the subsequent transport of CO and ozone by large-scale weather patterns. It appears that both CO and ozone are being transported thousands of kilometers from their source regions by the prevailing winds.},

On nine occasions between September 1991 and April 1993, pressure-volume curves were constructed for irrigated and rainfed Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus Labill. and E. nitens (Deane and Maiden) Maiden trees. During the experiment, rainfed trees experienced six periods when predawn water potential was significantly lower than that of irrigated trees. In early spring of 1991 and 1992, osmotic potentials at full turgor and turgor loss point in the irrigated E. nitens were significantly lower than at other times of the year, probably because of winter hardening. Water stress reduced osmotic potential and increased bulk elastic modulus in E. nitens, whereas the reverse occurred in E. globulus. However, treatment differences with respect to changes in osmotic and elastic properties were commonly overshadowed by interspecific differences. These were most apparent at the end of the sixth period of water stress when osmotic potentials at full and zero turgor were significantly higher and bulk elastic modulus and relative water content at turgor loss point were significantly lower in E. globulus than in E. nitens. We conclude that the drought-tolerance responses of E. globulus make it a more suitable species than E. nitens for establishment on sites where moderate water stress is experienced.},

Photons are emitted via electronic intersubband transitions that take place entirely within the conduction band, where the wavelength is chosen by engineering the well and barrier widths in multiple-quantum-well heterostructures. Fabrication of such long wavelength lasers has traditionally been challenging, since it is difficult to obtain a population inversion between such closely spaced energy levels (h\textasciimacron{$\omega$} {$\approx$} 4\textendash 40 meV), and because traditional dielectric waveguides become extremely lossy due to free carrier absorption.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Vascular epiphytes which can be abundant in tree crowns of tropical forests have to cope with low and highly intermittent water and nutrient supply from rainwater, throughfall and stem flow. Phosphorus rather than nitrogen has been suggested as the most limiting nutrient element, but, unlike nitrogen, this element has received little attention in physiological studies. This motivated the present report, in which phosphate uptake kinetics by leaves and roots, the subsequent distribution within plants and the metabolic fate of phosphate were studied as a step towards an improved understanding of physiological adaptations to the conditions of tree canopies. Methods Radioactively labelled [32P]phosphate was used to study uptake kinetics and plant distribution of phosphorus absorbed from bromeliad tanks. The metabolism of low molecular phosphorus metabolites was analysed by thin-layer chromatography followed by autoradiography. Key Results Uptake of phosphate from tanks is an ATP-dependent process. The kinetics of phosphorus uptake suggest that epiphytes possess effective phosphate transporters. The Km value of 1{$\cdot$}05 \textmu m determined for leaves of the bromeliad Aechmea fasciata is comparable with values obtained for the high affinity phosphate transporters in roots of terrestrial plants. In this species, young leaves are the main sink for phosphate absorbed from tank water. Within these leaves, phosphate is then allocated from the basal uptake zone into distal sections of the leaves. More than 80 \% of the phosphate incorporated into leaves is not used in metabolism but stored as phytin. Conclusions Tank epiphytes are adapted to low and intermittent nutrient supply by different mechanisms. They possess an effective mechanism to take up phosphate, minimizing dilution and loss of phosphorus captured in the tank. Available phosphorus is taken up from the tank solution almost quantitatively, and the surplus not needed for current metabolism is accumulated in reserves, i.e. plants show luxury consumption. Young, developing leaves are preferentially supplied with this nutrient element. Taken together, these features allow epiphytes the efficient use of scarce and variable nutrient supplies.},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content, a good indicator of photosynthesis activity, mutations, stress and nutritional state, is of special significance to precision agriculture. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of retrieval of chlorophyll content from hyperspectral vegetation indices composed by the reflectance of specific bands. In this paper, a set of vegetation indices belonged to three classes (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified simple ratio (MSR) index and the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI, TCARI) and the integrated forms (MCARI/OSAVI and TCARI/OSAVI)) were tested using the PROSPECT and SAIL models to explore their potentials in chlorophyll content estimation. Different bands combinations were also used to derive the modified vegetation indices. In the sensitivity study, four new formed indices (MSR[705,750], MCARI[705,750], TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750]) were proved to have better linearity with chlorophyll content and resistant to leaf area index (LAI) variations by taking into account the effect of quick saturation at 670nm with relatively low chlorophyll content. Validation study was also conducted at canopy scale using the ground truth data in the growth duration of winter wheat (chlorophyll content and reflectance data). The results showed that the integrated indices TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750] are most appropriate for chlorophyll estimation with high correlation coefficients R2 of 0.8808 and 0.9406, respectively, because more disturbances such as shadow, soil reflectance and nonphotosynthetic materials are taken into account. The high correlation between the vegetation indices obtained in the developmental stages of wheat and Hyperion data (R2 of 0.6798 and 0.7618 for TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750], respectively) indicated that these two integrated index can be used in practice to estimate the chlorophylls of different types of corns.},

  abstract = {Background Phosphorus is one of the macronutrients essential for plant growth and development. The acquisition and translocation of phosphate are pivotal processes of plant growth. In a large number of plants, phosphate uptake by roots and translocation within the plant are presumed to occur via a phosphate/proton cotransport mechanism. Principal Findings We cloned two cDNAs from soybean (Glycine max), GmPT1 and GmPT2, which show homology to the phosphate/proton cotransporter PHO84 from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amino acid sequence of the products predicted from GmPT1 and GmPT2 share 61\% and 63\% identity, respectively, with the PHO84 in amino acid sequence. The deduced structure of the encoded proteins revealed 12 membrane-spanning domains with a central hydrophilic region. The molecular mass values are {$\sim$}58.7 kDa for GmPT1 and {$\sim$}58.6 kDa for GmPT2. Transiently expressed GFP\textendash protein fusions provide direct evidence that the two Pi transporters are located in the plasma membrane. Uptake of radioactive orthophosphate by the yeast mutant MB192 showed that GmPT1 and GmPT2 are dependent on pH and uptake is reduced by the addition of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. The Km for phosphate uptake by GmPT1 and GmPT2 is 6.65 mM and 6.63 mM, respectively. A quantitative real time RT-PCR assay indicated that these two genes are expressed in the roots and shoots of seedlings whether they are phosphate-deficient or not. Deficiency of phosphorus caused a slight change of the expression levels of GmPT1 and GmPT2. Conclusions The results of our experiments show that the two phosphate transporters have low affinity and the corresponding genes are constitutively expressed. Thereby, the two phosphate transporters can perform translocation of phosphate within the plant.},

  abstract = {The scope and potential uses of time-domain terahertz imaging and spectroscopy are mainly limited by the low optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency of photoconductive terahertz sources. State-of-the-art photoconductive sources utilize short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors to recombine carriers that cannot contribute to efficient terahertz generation and cause additional thermal dissipation. Here, we present a novel photoconductive terahertz source that offers a significantly higher efficiency compared with terahertz sources fabricated on short-carrier-lifetime substrates. The key innovative feature of this source is the tight three-dimensional confinement of the optical pump beam around the terahertz nanoantennas that are used as radiating elements. This is achieved by means of a nanocavity formed by plasmonic structures and a distributed Bragg reflector. Consequently, almost all of the photo-generated carriers can be routed to the terahertz nanoantennas within a sub-picosecond time-scale. This results in a very strong, ultrafast current that drives the nanoantennas to produce broadband terahertz radiation. We experimentally demonstrate that this terahertz source can generate 4\,mW pulsed terahertz radiation under an optical pump power of 720\,mW over the 0.1\textendash 4\,THz frequency range. This is the highest reported power level for terahertz radiation from a photoconductive terahertz source, representing more than an order of magnitude of enhancement in the optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency compared with state-of-the-art photoconductive terahertz sources fabricated on short-carrier-lifetime substrates.}

Here, we present a powerful technique for realizing broadband terahertz detectors through large-area plasmonic photoconductive nano-antenna arrays.

The large device active area allows robust operation against optical and terahertz beam misalignments. We demonstrate broadband terahertz detection with signal-to-noise ratio levels as high as 107 dB.},

  abstract = {Insufficient nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) frequently limit primary production. Although most nutrient studies on vascular epiphytes have focused on N uptake, circumstantial evidence suggests that P rather than N is the most limiting element for growth in this plant group. We directly tested this by subjecting a total of 162 small individuals of three bromeliad species (Guzmania monostachia, Tillandsia elongata, Werauhia sanguinolenta) to three N and three P levels using a full-factorial experimental design, and determined relative growth rates (RGR) and nutrient acquisition over a period of 11~weeks. Both N and P supply had a significant effect on RGR, but only tissue P concentrations were correlated with growth. Uptake rates of N and P, in contrast, were not correlated with RGR. Increased nutrient supply led to an up to sevenfold increase in tissue P concentration compared to natural conditions, while concentrations of N hardly changed or even decreased. All treatment combinations, even at the lowest experimental P supply, led to decreased N:P ratios. We conclude that P is at least as limiting as N for vegetative function under natural conditions in these epiphytic bromeliads. This conclusion is in line with the general notion of the prevalence of P limitation for the functioning of terrestrial vegetation in the tropics.},

It is argued that by far the most relevant abiotic constraint for growth and vegetative function of vascular epiphytes is water shortage, while other factors such as nutrient availability or irradiation, are generally of inferior importance. However, it is shown that the present understanding of epiphyte biology is still highly biased, both taxonomically and ecologically, and it is concluded that any generalizations are still preliminary. Future studies should include a much wider range of taxa and growing sites within the canopy to reach a better understanding how abiotic factors are limiting epiphyte growth and survival which, in turn, should affect epiphyte community composition. Finally, a more integrative approach to epiphyte biology is encouraged: physiological investigations should be balanced by studies of other possible constraints, for example, substrate instability, dispersal limitation, competition or herbivory.},
